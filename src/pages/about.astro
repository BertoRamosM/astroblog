      <h1 class="text-4xl text-red-700 mb-4">I'm Alberto Ramos</h1>

      <p>
        As you already know, here
        you'll read about me and one of my passions: web development. Initially,
        the idea of creating this blog was to practice some modern technologies,
        but it ended up becoming a place where I pour out my thoughts, ideas,
        and, of course, rant about the frustrations of programming (which
        eventually turn into big satisfactions). Take your time exploring the
        blog, and let me know if you find any errors in the website or the text.
        Or just drop a note to let me know you've been hereâ€”that would mean a
        lot to me!
