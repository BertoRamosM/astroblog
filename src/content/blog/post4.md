# Introduction to Front-End Frameworks

## What are Front-End Frameworks?
Front-end frameworks are libraries that provide pre-written, standardized code to help build web applications faster and more efficiently. Popular frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js.

### React Basics
```jsx
// React component example
import React from 'react';

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
            <p>This is a React component.</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
