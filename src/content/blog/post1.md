# Introduction to HTML and CSS

## What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage, allowing you to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

### Basic HTML Structure
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
